	<h2>Position</h2>
	<p>Stand next to a table (or something else that can support when necessary).</p>
	<h2>Indication</h2>
	<p>Tilt the leg backwards (extention) as far as possible. Make sure to keep the pelvis and upper body straight. Don&#39;t make any rotation in the hip and upper body.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>When the person stands straight, this must be indicated as 0&ordm; and the degrees when the leg stretches backwards must be calculated.</li>
